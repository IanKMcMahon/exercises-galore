# ****How Web Works Exercise****

## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?

Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is a common protocol used to tranfer information across a network

- What is a URL?

Uniform Resource Locator. Using a protocol like http or https, URLs serve as an address, a way to reference or find web resources.

- What is DNS?

Domain Name System. This is a 'phonebook' of the internet in which all resources are given an IP Address

- What is a query string?

The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?

GET and POST. GET is used on pages and resources that don't have side effects Whereas POST is the opposite (i.e. credit card purchase).

- What is an HTTP request?

An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol

- What is an HTTP response?

An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.

- Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

Using DNS, the browser deciphers the URL into an IP Address. A request is then made to that address. The server then sends a response accompanied by a code (ie 200). 
The browser then compiles all resources and makes a DOM. It includes any and all additional HTTP requests and receives seperate responses for each from the server.
